I'm a social entrepreneur, product manager, and multi-instrumentalist based in Brooklyn NY.

I cofounded [Good Call](https://goodcall.nyc) in October of 2016. Our mission is to disrupt the cycle of mass incarceration through Early Legal Intervention. We use technology to run a free 24/7 hotline that allows anyone to connect with a free lawyer right away, if they or a loved one get arrested. We're trying to make sure everyone can get the support they need to avoid getting unnecessarily wrapped up in the criminal justice system.

I play bass and write original music for Quarter Water, a hip-hop/ neosoul band based in Brooklyn, featuring rapper [Googie](https://www.facebook.com/GoogieGoHard/). You can find our music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6JMNTAEnyF5TD5PQxu1i6t?si=YD0eaWWzSWePyGk3zG1oxw), and follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/quarterwatermusic/) for info on upcoming shows. 

I produce hip-hop, R&B, and electronic music rooted in my background as a jazz upright bassist. I've collaborated with artists like [Junglepussy](https://soundcloud.com/junglepussy/spicy-103-fm-prod-by-shy-guy-cousin-gabriel), [P'tah Johnson](https://soundcloud.com/ptahmusic/selfish-love), and [Googie](https://open.spotify.com/track/7koPcRaQ00wjomx9wwjDhs?si=4hwuqISaTaqafREMsJzhpw), and most recently released a project called [GAMMA](https://open.spotify.com/artist/70V2E8b0e9LkDBjdH4pRRI?si=d_lRYnHOQeyEjmPZas8trQ) with singer Melina Harris. I'm always looking for new artists to collaborate with.

I occasionally teach product management at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/), and am sometimes available for product management and strategy consulting. I've worked on a wide variety of physical and digital products at [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/), [Def Method](https://www.defmethod.com/), and more.
