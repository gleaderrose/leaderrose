I'm a social entrepreneur, product manager, bassist, and music producer. 

I cofounded [Good Call](www.goodcall.nyc) in October of 2016. We use technology to run a free 24/7 hotline that allows anyone to connect with a free lawyer right away, if they or a loved one get arrested. We're trying to make sure everyone can get the support they need to avoid getting unnecessarily wrapped up in the criminal justice system.

I produce hip-hop, R&B, and textural electronic music rooted in my background as a jazz upright bassist. I released my first EP Elements on [Beat Haus Records](http://www.beathausshow.com/) in 2016, which can be found on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2dmybITq1IS3sY6umWr08y) or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/beathausshow/sets/cousin-gabriel-elements-ep). I'm always looking for new artists to collaborate with.

I play bass and write original music for [Quarter Water](https://www.facebook.com/quarterwatermusic/), a hip-hop/ neosoul band based in Brooklyn, featuring rapper [Googie](https://www.facebook.com/GoogieGoHard/). You can find out about upcoming shows on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/quarterwatermusic/) page. Our first demo is coming out soon. Stay tuned.

I am teaching a product management course at General Assembly this March, and am sometimes available for freelance product management engagements. I've worked on a wide variety of physical and digital products at [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/) and [Def Method](https://www.defmethod.com/).

I live in Bed-Stuy with my girlfriend Aimee, who makes super cool leather stuff and runs [Phelan](https://www.thisisphelan.com/).
