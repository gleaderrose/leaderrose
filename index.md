I'm a social entrepreneur, product manager, bassist, and music producer based in Brooklyn NY.

I cofounded [Good Call](https://goodcall.nyc) in October of 2016. We use technology to run a free 24/7 hotline that allows anyone to connect with a free lawyer right away, if they or a loved one get arrested. We're trying to make sure everyone can get the support they need to avoid getting unnecessarily wrapped up in the criminal justice system.

I produce hip-hop, R&B, and textural electronic music rooted in my background as a jazz upright bassist. I released my first EP Elements on [Beat Haus Records](http://www.beathausshow.com/) in 2016, which can be found on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2dmybITq1IS3sY6umWr08y) or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/beathausshow/sets/cousin-gabriel-elements-ep). I've coproduced and produced beats for artists like [Junglepussy](https://soundcloud.com/junglepussy/spicy-103-fm-prod-by-shy-guy-cousin-gabriel), [P'tah Johnson](https://soundcloud.com/ptahmusic/selfish-love), [Melina Harris](https://open.spotify.com/artist/70V2E8b0e9LkDBjdH4pRRI?si=d_lRYnHOQeyEjmPZas8trQ)and [Googie](https://open.spotify.com/track/7koPcRaQ00wjomx9wwjDhs?si=4hwuqISaTaqafREMsJzhpw). I'm always looking for new artists to collaborate with.

I play bass and write original music for Quarter Water, a hip-hop/ neosoul band based in Brooklyn, featuring rapper [Googie](https://www.facebook.com/GoogieGoHard/). You can find our music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6JMNTAEnyF5TD5PQxu1i6t?si=YD0eaWWzSWePyGk3zG1oxw), follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/quarterwatermusic/) for info on upcoming shows. 

I occasionally teach product management [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/), and am sometimes available for product management consulting. I've worked on a wide variety of physical and digital products at [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/), [Def Method](https://www.defmethod.com/), and more.
